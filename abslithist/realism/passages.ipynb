       ", I found several Things of great Use to me: For Example, I found in one a <i><u>fine</u></i> Case of <i><u>Bottles</u></i>, of an <i><b>extraordinary</b></i> <i>Kind</i>, and <i>filled</i> with <i>Cordial</i> <i>Waters</i>, <i><u>fine</u></i>, and very good; the <i><u>Bottles</u></i> <i>held</i> about three <i><u>Pints</u></i> each, and were <i><u>tipped</u></i> with <i><u>Silver</u></i>: I found two <i><u>Pots</u></i> of very good Succades, or <i><u>Sweetmeats</u></i>, so <i><u>fastened</u></i> also on Top, that the <i><u>Salt</u></i> <i><u>Water</u></i> had not <i>hurt</i> them; and two more of the same, which the <i><u>Water</u></i> had <i>spoiled</i>: I found some very good <i><u>Shirts</u></i>, which were very welcome to me, and about a <i><u>Dozen</u></i> and <i><u>half</u></i> of <i><u>Linnen</u></i> <i><u>white</u></i> <i><u>Handkerchiefs</u></i>, and <i><u>coloured</u></i> Neckloths; the former were also very welcome, being <i>exceeding</i> <i>refreshing</i> to <i>wipe</i> my <i>Face</i> in a <i><u>hight</u></i> Day; beside this, when I came to the Till in the <i><u>Chests</u></i>, I found there three great <i><u>Bags</u></i> of <i><u>Pieces</u></i> of Eight, which <i>held</i> out about eleven hundred <i><u>Pieces</u></i> in all; and in one of them, <i><u>wrapped</u></i> up in a <i>Paper</i>, six <i><u>Doubloons</u></i> of <i><u>Gold</u></i>, and some <i>small</i> <i><u>Bars</u></i> or <i><u>Wedges</u></i> of <i><u>Gold</u></i>; I <i><b>suppose</b></i> they might all <i>weigh</i> near a <i><u>Pound</u></i>. The other <i><u>Chest</u></i> I found had some <i><u>Cloaths</u></i> in it, but of little Value; but by the Circumstances it must have <i>belonged</i> to the <i><u>Gunner</u></i>'s <i>Mate</i>, though there was no <i><u>Powder</u></i> in it, but about two <i><u>Pound</u></i> of <i><u>fine</u></i> <i><u>glazed</u></i> <i><u>Powder</u></i>, in three <i>small</i> <i><u>Flasks</u></i>, kept, I <i><b>suppose</b></i>, for <i>charging</i> their <i><u>Fowling</u></i> <i><u>Pieces</u></i> on Occasion: Upon the Whole, I God very little by this <i>Voyage</i>, that was of any Use to me; for as to the <i>Money</i>, I had no Manner of Occasion for it;'it to me as the <i><u>Dirt</u></i> under my <i><u>Feet</u></i>; and I would have given it all for three or four <i><u>Pair</u></i> of <i>English</i> <i><u>Shoes</u></i> and <i><u>Stockings</u></i>, which were Things I <i><b>greatly</b></i> wanted, but had not had on my <i><u>Feet</u></i> now for many Years: I had, indeed, got two <i><u>Pair</u></i> of <i><u>Shoes</u></i> now, which I took off of the <i><u>Feet</u></i> of the two <i>drowned</i> Men, who I saw in the <i>Wreck</i>; and I found two <i><u>Pair</u></i> more in one of the <i><u>Chests</u></i>, which were very welcome to me; but they were not Like our <i>English</i> <i><u>Shoes</u></i>, either for <i>Ease</i> or <i>Service</i>, being rather what we call <i><u>Pumps</u></i> than <i><u>Shoes</u></i>: I found in this <i>Seaman</i>'s <i><u>Chest</u></i> about <i>fifty</i> <i><u>Pieces</u></i> of Eight in <i><u>Royals</u></i>, but no <i><u>Gold</u></i>; I <i><b>suppose</b></i> this <i>belonged</i> to a <i>poorer</i> Man than the other, which seemed to <i>belong</i> to some <i>Officer</i>.
